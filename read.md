# Bootstrap 5 UI Exploration Task

## [cite_start]Project Step-by-Step [cite: 48]
1. Set up the basic file structure (`index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`).
2. Integrated the Bootstrap 5 CDN into all pages.
3. Designed the global Navbar and Footer to ensure consistency across pages.
4. Built the Home page focusing on a Hero section and feature cards.
5. Developed the Services page using responsive Bootstrap card components.
6. Created the Contact page featuring a functional form layout.

## [cite_start]Use of External Tools [cite: 49, 53]
* **Bootstrap Documentation:** Heavily relied on the official docs to understand classes for padding, margins, and flexbox.
* **AI Tools:** Used Gemini to generate the initial boilerplate code structure and to understand the specific file requirements of the prompt.
* **Snippets:** Extracted standard navbar and form structures from Bootstrap Examples but remixed the layout and colors to fit the theme.

## [cite_start]Challenges & Solutions [cite: 50]
* **Challenge:** Keeping the footer stuck to the bottom of the page when there was little content.
* **Solution:** Used Bootstrap utility classes `d-flex flex-column min-vh-100` on the `body` and `mt-auto` on the `footer`.

## [cite_start]Learning Journey [cite: 51]
This project helped me understand how powerful Bootstrap utility classes are. Instead of writing custom CSS for every little spacing adjustment, I learned to rely on `p-4`, `mb-3`, and the grid system (`col-md-4`) to build responsive layouts quickly.
